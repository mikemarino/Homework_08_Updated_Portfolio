# Homework_08_Updated_Portfolio

Hello - This repository will serve as homework assignment submission to the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. This assignment is intended to engage the student in using <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to create a fully responsive portfolio. This site will serve as the foundation for a much better looking and functional website in the near future.

My the layout for my desing was based the professionally designed bootstrap themes offered by 3rd Wave Media. Found here: https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/


To create the sidebar naviaion, I referenced a tutorial from Bootstrapious for using a sidebar as a navigation panel. https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar
